# FMod-media-Archive
This is just made to archive some photos of FMod. If you don't know what FMod is, it's an og fortnite project that released back in 2023. I loved and charished that server so much and even now I'm still obsessed with it. They shutdown during summer after their head developer of the launcher added rat/virus into the launcher causing a shutdown forever.

Most of this media is from discord.gg/fmod aka farexs rift (spelled wrong Ik). Ferex used that server to keep the fmod vanity safe from scammers!
